# Encrypted War Games: Strategic Combat on the Blockchain Litepaper

**Author**: [xrpant](https://github.com/anthonybautista)

## What Makes This Different

Imagine playing a strategy game where your opponents can't see your moves until it's too late. No more front-running, no more copying successful strategies, no more transparent blockchain ruining the surprise. This is the first blockchain game with real **fog of war**.

Every attack, every defensive move, every resource allocation stays completely hidden until combat resolves. Your enemies see that you attacked Bunker 3, but they have no idea if you sent 1 token or 1 million tokens. Did you go all-in on offense, or did you secretly stockpile defense? They won't know until the smoke clears.

## The Battlefield

```

```

Five bunkers. One central hub. The map is simple, but the strategy is infinite.

**Bunker 3** is the prize - it connects to everywhere and earns **double rewards**. But with great reward comes great risk. Everyone can attack the center, making it the most dangerous position on the map.

## How You Play

### Deploy Your Army
Start by committing at least 10,000 tokens to any bunker. This is your base of operations, your stake in the war. The more you deploy, the bigger your potential rewards - but also the bigger your target.

### Choose Your Strategy
Every 8-hour round, you face a critical decision:

**Attack** - Allocate your resources to assault an enemy bunker
**Defend** - Fortify your position against incoming attacks  
**Move** - Relocate to a better strategic position
**Retreat** - Cut your losses and escape with what you can

The twist? You must split your resources between attack and defense every turn. Going all-in on offense leaves you defenseless. Playing too safe means missing opportunities to eliminate enemies.

### The Fog of War Advantage
Here's where it gets interesting. When you submit your move, opponents see:
- ✅ That you attacked Bunker 5
- ❌ How many tokens you allocated to attack
- ❌ How many tokens you kept for defense
- ❌ Your overall strategy

This creates genuine strategic depth. Bluffing matters. Misdirection works. Reading opponents becomes an art form.

### Combat Resolution
Every 8 hours, the **Waracle** reveals all hidden moves simultaneously:

1. **Damage Calculation**: Attack tokens vs Defense tokens at each bunker
2. **Destruction Check**: Take more damage than your total deployment? You're eliminated. All tokens gone.
3. **Rewards Distribution**: Survivors split the round's token emissions
4. **Reset**: All attack/defense tokens disappear. Clean slate for next round.

## Risk vs Reward

### The High-Stakes Economics

This isn't play money. Real tokens, real gains, real losses. 

**Survive and Prosper**: Every round you survive earns you a share of 6 billion tokens distributed over 3+ years.

**Get Eliminated, Lose Everything**: Take too much damage and your bunker is destroyed. All your tokens burn. Game over.

### Possible Rewards (First Year) *for illustration purposes only*

With 675M tokens (25% of circulating) in play across all bunkers:

**Standard Bunker That Takes No Damage**
- Starting deployment: 112.5M tokens
- Annual return: **444% APY**

**Bunker 3 (High Risk/High Reward)**  
- Double rewards but maximum exposure
- Starting deployent: 225M tokens
- Same **444% APY** if no damage taken (easier with more resources to defend with)

**Low Competition Scenario**
- Only 25M tokens deployed total to a bunker and take no damage
- Annual return: **2,000% APY**
- Risk: You're the biggest target

**Total Elimination**
- Bunker destroyed = **100% loss**
- No insurance, no second chances

## Strategic Depth

### Positioning Matters
- **Corner bunkers (1,2,4,5)**: Safer but lower connectivity
- **Central bunker (3)**: Maximum risk, maximum reward
- **Movement**: Only between connected bunkers

### Information Warfare
- **Visible**: Who's attacking whom, bunker survival/destruction
- **Hidden**: Attack/defense allocation, individual spending, strategic patterns
- **Psychological**: Reading opponents, building reputation, creating fear

### Timing is Everything
- **Early game**: Low competition, high returns, positioning advantages
- **Mid game**: Territory control, alliance potential, elimination risks  
- **Late game**: Survivor rewards, defensive positioning, calculated risks

## What Makes You Win

### Short-term Tactics
- **Resource allocation**: Attack vs defense balance each round
- **Target selection**: When to attack, when to fortify
- **Movement timing**: Repositioning for advantage
- **Bluff management**: Misdirecting opponents about your strength

### Long-term Strategy  
- **Bunker selection**: Risk tolerance vs reward potential
- **Survival focus**: Staying alive beats being aggressive
- **Timing markets**: When to enter, when to retreat
- **Coalition building**: Informal alliances and betrayals

### The Meta Game
- **Reputation building**: Known players get different treatment
- **Pattern recognition**: Learning opponent tendencies
- **Psychological warfare**: Creating fear, uncertainty, doubt
- **Market timing**: Entering when competition is low

## The Future of Warfare

This is just the beginning. The system supports:

### Expanded Battlefields
- **Multiple maps**: Different strategic environments
- **Larger conflicts**: More bunkers, more complexity
- **Dynamic terrain**: Maps that evolve based on combat history

### Advanced Warfare
- **NFT weapons**: Unique equipment providing combat bonuses
- **Upgradeable bunkers**: Persistent improvements that survive rounds  
- **Specialized units**: Artillery, engineers, scouts with unique abilities
- **Alliance systems**: Formal coalitions with shared resources

### Competitive Evolution
- **Tournaments**: Seasonal competitions with exclusive rewards
- **Leagues**: Skill-based matchmaking and progression
- **Cross-game progression**: Reputation and achievements across multiple instances

## Why This Changes Gaming

Traditional blockchain games fail because transparency kills strategy. When everyone can see your moves, there's no strategy - just optimization and front-running.

Encrypted War Games brings back what makes games fun:
- **Surprise attacks** that actually surprise
- **Bluffing** that works  
- **Strategic depth** beyond spreadsheet optimization
- **Genuine competition** where skill matters more than gas fees

The blockchain provides what traditional games can't:
- **True ownership** of your position and rewards
- **Transparent rules** that can't be changed mid-game
- **Real economic stakes** that make every decision matter
- **Permissionless competition** - anyone can play, anytime

## Ready for War?

This isn't just a game - it's a new category of strategic competition where privacy creates strategy, risk creates reward, and survival creates legends.

The battlefield awaits. Choose your bunker wisely.
